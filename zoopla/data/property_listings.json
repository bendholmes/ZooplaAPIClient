Steeped in history with original features including cruck beam, inglenook fireplace and stone mullion windows.DescriptionThe owners currently run all three properties as holiday cottages graded 4/5 star and have done so for over a decade and are enthusiastic about handing over the benefit of their considerable experience, booking systems and forward bookings to new owners.Knowl CottageThe principal cottage, Knowl Cottage is believed to be at least five hundred years old with some fine period features including an original Cruck beam whilst offering modern conveniences. Knowl Cottage is currently used as a holiday let along with the two smaller cottages, Dove and Manifold, however it could easily be used as a family residence, as it has been in the past, perhaps in conjunction with use as a guest house. The cottages have high occupancy levels and good rental rates therefore they currently offer profitable holiday letting business. Knowl Cottage: The accommodation is over two floors with the front door leading into an entrance hall with staircase rising to the first floor. To the right of the hall is the sitting room (14' x 12' 11\") with beamed ceiling, working fireplace with Inglenook and stone mullioned windows. To the left of the hall is the well fitted kitchen-dining area (12' 9\" x 14' 3\") which overlooks the street. To the first floor are three double bedrooms each with good sized en suite bath/shower room. The third bedroom gives an insight into the past with sight of the Cruck and ceiling beams. Bedroom One (14' 9\" x 15' 8\" max.) with En-Suite Shower, Bedroom Two (8' 3\" x 12') with En-Suite Bathroom and Bedroom Three (10' 9\" x 13' 1\") with En-Suite Shower Room. Outside to the front of the property is a modest but very pretty and much photographed cottage garden. Knowl Cottage has been rated five stars by the English Tourist Board. In 2013 the cottage had a new central heating boiler.To the rear of Knowl Cottage is a courtyard offering a sitting out area and off road parking which then leads to the other two cottages which have been converted from an original barn and are ideal as two person holiday cottages. Both of these cottages, like Knowl, have beamed ceilings and benefit from central heating. There is a large ancillary room in the courtyard recently converted to become a dedicated sky sports room for shared use by the guests of the three cottages.Dove CottageDove Cottage is the right hand side of the two cottages with the front door opening into the sitting room with fireplace. To the first floor is a well fitted kitchen with dining area and a double bedroom with en suite bathroom. To the front of the cottage is a sitting out area.Entrance Door In To Lounge 16' 2\" x 10' 3\" ( 4.93m x 3.12m )With stairs off to first floor accommodation, radiator, window to rear, feature fireplace, laminate floor, door to frontFirst FloorOpen Plan Kitchen Diner 17' 2\" minimum x 7' 6\" ( 5.23m minimum x 2.29m )With a range of wall and base mounted units with rolled edge work surfaces and tiled splashbacks, exposed beams, space for cooker, single drainer sink unit with mixer tap, two windows to front and one window to side and radiator and door leading to Bedroom.Bedroom 8' 5\" x 10' 10\" ( 2.57m x 3.30m )With window to side, radiator and exposed beam.En-Suite BathroomWith three piece suite comprising bath with shower over, hand wash basin and wc, tiled floor, radiator, tank in airing cupboard and extractor.Manifold CottageManifold Cottage is the left hand cottage with the front door leading into the kitchen/breakfast room (8' 4\" x 10' 3\") which in turn opens into the sitting room (16' 3\" max.

(10' 2 x 16' 6\").OutsideDriveway from road at the side of Knowl Cottage leads to further driveway and parking and there are gardens with borders of mature shrubs and area with oil tank.Lettings InformationPerhaps primarily due to their location the lettings record for the cottages is enviable. For the last five years all three cottages have been booked almost continuously between Easter and the end of October. In winter most weekend are booked up as are some mid weeks.Further information on the cottages, including current rentals, can be found by visiting our client's website: AmenitiesPebbled patio areas.Laundry Room (14' 1\" x 6' 11\") with plumbing for automatic washing machine and power and lighting.Sky Sports Room (15' 4\" x 14' 1\") with laminate floor, wall lighting, door to front, UPVC double glazed window to front and wc located off, which has hand wash basin, wc, tiled splashbacks.SituationHartington is a charming village with plenty for visitors to do; there are a couple of public houses, a church and a number of shops and tea rooms. It is only a couple of hundred yards to the River Dove and is therefore an excellent base for walking. Hartington is located close to the Buxton to Ashbourne road (A515) and thus offers good access to both towns with their excellent range of shops, restaurants and transport facilites with the train from Buxton going to Manchester. Furthermore, Buxton has the well renowned Opera House which has a wide programme throughout the year. Hartington is also situated within three miles of the Tissington, High Peak and Manifold Valley trails which offer excellent oppourtunities for walking, riding and cycling with bike for hire at nearby Parsley Hay. Within driving distance are a range of interesting and impressive country houses including Chatsworth House, Haddon and Tissington Halls.Photographs - The first 7 pictures are of Knowl Cottage, the last 5 pictures are of the one bedroom cottages.1.

The house commands views to front and rear of the unspoilt limestone Crome and Hollins Hills. Accommodation includes large entrance hall, two receptions, fitted kitchen and family bathroom. Lawns to front and side and a cobbled driveway with dry stone wall boundaries.Hollinsclough is a small, picturesque Peak District village, in the upper Dove valley. It is a stone built village, set amid some splendid unspoilt limestone scenery. The attractive stone houses, chapel and village hall are flanked by the remarkable peaks of Crome, Hollins and Parkhouse Hills; coral reef limestone peaks that rise gracefully to give them the appearance of mountains.The position of the village, between moorland, open hills, rivers, streams and the peaks make it a unique location for a wide variety of activities. The stunning scenery has provided the backdrop for a number of films and TV programmes including Peak Practice and films such as Pride and Prejudice.Hollinsclough had a thriving silk weaving cottage industry back in the 18th century. Material was transported by pack horse to the silk mills at Macclesfield. Several of the old pack horse bridges and footpaths remain in the area as walks, cyclepaths and bridleways.There is still a thriving school, situated behind its 19th century predecessor, the Frank Wheldon School, an imposing building topped with a wooden 'dove-cote' bell tower which once summoned the children from outlying farms to school.
